# 🚀 Project Achievement: SwiftShop - A Premium E-commerce Experience

I am excited to share my latest project, **SwiftShop**, a full-featured E-commerce application built with **Flutter** and **Supabase**! 🛍️✨

This project represents a deep dive into modern mobile development, Clean Architecture, and premium UI design.

### 🌟 Key Highlights:
*   **Sleek & Modern UI**: Implemented **Glassmorphism**, **Bento Grid** layouts, and smooth animations for a top-tier user experience.
*   **Robust Backend**: Integrated **Supabase** for secure Authentication (Email/Password) and real-time database management.
*   **State Management**: Utilized **Riverpod** for efficient and scalable state handling across the app.
*   **Offline Capability**: Implemented **Hive** for local storage, ensuring the cart and settings persist even without internet.
*   **Dark Mode**: A fully responsive Dark Mode that looks just as good as the light theme. 🌑

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
*   **Flutter & Dart**
*   **Supabase** (Auth & Database)
*   **Riverpod** (State Management)
*   **Hive** (Local Storage)
*   **Animated Login** & **Google Fonts**

This project pushed me to solve real-world challenges like secure role-based access (Admin Panel), responsiveness across devices, and creating a cohesive design system.
